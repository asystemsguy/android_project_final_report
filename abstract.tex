Smartphones are increasingly becoming an important part of our life. With a limited battery capacity in smartphones, energy efficiency is an important requirement for good android applications. Applications in a smartphone can have varying degrees of importance for android user. For example, healthcare apps tied to a smartwatch and financial apps which report real-time market updates may be more critical and important to users than mobile games. In the current Android system, there is no feature for user to give more importance for energy usage of certain apps over other. To address this, in this project, we implemented an EnergyMAC framework which enables users to prioritize energy for high priority applications installed on their smartphones.
